						Thank you for participating in this study, which investigates how peer comparison makes it more or less easy to switch between tasks and avoid distraction. In this particular experiment, we were looking to see if you would be able to switch between tasks more easily if you believed you were performing worse on switch trials (changing from one task to another) than your peers, and if this came at the cost of greater distractibility and vice versa if you believed you were performing worse at ignoring distractors than your peers. In order to do so, we gave you feedback about your performance relative to other study participants. <b>This feedback was in no way related to your actual task performance.</b> Rather, feedback was determined randomly and for the purposes of the experiment. We predicted that it would be become easier for you to switch between trials if you thought you were performing worse on switches than your peers, and that you would become better at ignoring distractors if you thought you were doing a worse job at ignoring distractors than your peers.
